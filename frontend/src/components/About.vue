          <b>Alterspace</b> is an immersive library experience that puts visitors in charge of their surroundings. The
          library’s collection can transport patrons
          into the worlds of fiction, history, art. Alterspace extends that experience into the physical world, allowing
          patrons to create environments that best suit their needs.
        </p>

          Control over light, color, sound and space gives visitors the chance to create their ideal environment for
          meditating, reading, collaborating, playing, or whatever activity brings them through the library’s doors.
          Made possible by the Knight Foundation, Alterspace is an experiment in digital placemaking and adaptive,
          emancipatory design in public spaces of all kinds. All work done for the project will be open source and
          available to any library who would like to replicate it. Visitors to the Cambridge Public Library will
          participate in the first installation and will be invited to provide feedback for future improvements.
