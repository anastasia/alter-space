## Lights
We used [LIFX lights](http://lifx.com/) for our first implementation.
To set up your lights, you will need to download the lifx app from the android or apple app store
Your lights will need to have been added to the WIFI network using your phone, before they can be added to the app.
Follow the setup here: https://lifx.typeform.com/to/fQ9I3W


Once you are done, go to http://localhost:8080 and you should be redirected to the lights setup in the app. 
If you're not automatically redirected, go to http://localhost:8080/#/lights
