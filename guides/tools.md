## List of tools you will need:
    
Hardware:
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
- Raspberry Pi SD card â€” 16GB 
- [Raspberry Pi universal power supply](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-universal-power-supply/#buy-now-modal)
  You can use other powerchords, but they have the potential to do harm to your Pi or not be powerful enough for it. This one has worked flawlessly for us.
- Router
   - You won't need to be connected to the internet, but you will need to serve the app and sounds locally. The sounds will require apache2 for setup (guide tbd). 
   - You will, however, need a normal router, like the kind you use for your home or office.
   - You might be tempted to use the Raspberry Pi as your router. DO NOT DO THIS! It will look tidy and cute up until the day of deployment.

- For sounds, see the [Sounds guide](./sounds.md)
